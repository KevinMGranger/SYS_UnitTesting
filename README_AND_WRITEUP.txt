PLEASE run without debugging (Ctrl+F5), so that the console window stays
open, and you can see the output.

# What framework did you use?

I chose to use [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch).

# What steps did you need to take in order to make it work?

I had to download the single header file and include it in my project.

Really, that's it!

# Was it intuitive?

Very! It's almost like writing plain english!

# Would you recommend this framework to other people?

Yes, and I already have.

# Is the framework well documented?

Yes! To quote the README from it, "The documentation will continue until morale improves"

# What problems did you have with unit testing?

Figuring out how to generate data for multiple test cases is a bit of a pain.

I'm not sure if Catch supports that very well. Perhaps I should write a custom
test-runner?

# Describe the code and the tests.
